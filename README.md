# Machine_learning_scratch_to_deployment
Models to develop without the inbuilt sklearn and tf models directly, to find the math and explanation behind each calculation.


different between the machines and humans are mostly like machines gives you the output based on the relation and math behind the problem.

human see the problem  directly as the question / issue, when it comes to the machine learning algorithms whatever iossue is need to based out in math function and relation.

# Supervised Learning Models
Supervised learning models are trained on labeled data (input-output pairs):

# y = mx + c
m = wieights of the following data 
c = bias 
the output is dependent  on these factors so called weights and bias.


1. Regression Models

Linear Regression 
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Elastic Net Regression
Polynomial Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
Bayesian Regression


2. Classification Models

Logistic Regression:

it is based out on the regression model equations (y = mx + c ) which is derived in log equation (sigmoid function) 
linear regression function: 


sigmoid function 
# f(x) = e^x /1+ e^x

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
Naive Bayes Classifier (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
Neural Networks / Deep Learning (MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.)
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
Perceptron

# Unsupervised Learning Models
Unsupervised learning models are trained on unlabeled data (no explicit outputs):

1. Clustering Models

K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative, Divisive)
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
Mean Shift Clustering
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
Birch Clustering
Spectral Clustering
Affinity Propagation


2. Dimensionality Reduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA, when used unsupervised)
Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
Factor Analysis
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
3. Association Rule Learning

Apriori Algorithm
Eclat Algorithm
FP-Growth
4. Anomaly Detection/Novelty Detection (Unsupervised)

One-Class SVM
Isolation Forest
Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Autoencoders (Unsupervised)
